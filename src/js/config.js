// We can generally fetch the recipe data using the API URL and the recipe ID.
// But for own uploaded recipe we are need to fetch the recipe data using the API URL, the recipe ID, and our API key.
// When we upload a recipe, it doesnâ€™t go to the public API openly to avoid contaminating the public data.
// Instead, it gets stored in the API under our API key.
// This means we can access our uploaded recipes only using our API key 
// although they are also on the public API but are stored under our API key so not accessible without API key 
// Therefore, when we search for recipes with our API key, the search results will include all recipes, including our uploaded ones.
// Additionally, when we click on one of our own recipes, the data is retrieved from the API only when using our API key = KEY.
